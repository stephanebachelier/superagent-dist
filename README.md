# superagent-dist

Browser distribution file for superagent. 

## Purpose

Official superagent release does not provide a browser build since 0.21 until now, at the date of writing, which is version 1.4.0.
Consuming superagent using bower is useless if you don't use browserify in your workflow.

Hence this build.
